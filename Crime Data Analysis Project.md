## **Overview of Tasks**

The project is structured as follows:

* **Task 1: Data Preprocessing**  
  Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.  
* **Task 2: RFM Calculation**  
  Compute Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.  
* **Task 3: RFM Segmentation**  
  Group customers based on RFM scores.  
* **Task 4: Customer Segmentation**  
  Use clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) for deeper segmentation.  
* **Task 5: Segment Profiling**  
  Define profiles for customer segments.  
* **Task 6: Marketing Recommendation**  
  Develop actionable strategies based on the analysis.  
* **Task 7: Visualization**  
  Present findings through effective charts and graphs.

## **Data Preprocessing**

Key preprocessing steps include:

* Handling missing data via imputation or row removal.  
* Converting date columns for time-based analysis.  
* Removing duplicate rows and invalid data (e.g., negative values).  
* Ensuring correct data types for efficient processing.

---

## **Analysis Framework**

1. **RFM Analysis**: Calculate recency, frequency, and monetary scores to understand customer behaviors.  
2. **Segmentation**: Use K-Means clustering to group customers into actionable segments.  
3. **Profiling**: Profile each segment to guide marketing strategies.

---

## **Visualizations**

Insights are presented through:

* Trends and seasonal patterns in crime rates.  
* Distribution of RFM scores and customer segmentation.  
* Cluster characteristics using box plots and heatmaps.

## **Recommendations**

**Key strategies include**:

1. **Engagement for High-Value Customers**: Loyalty programs and exclusive offers.  
2. **Reactivation Campaigns**: Incentives for inactive customers.  
3. **Upselling Opportunities**: Encourage frequent customers to spend more.
