Crime Data Analysis Project
IE6400 - Foundations of Data Analytics Engineering 

Objective
This project focuses on cleaning, inspecting, and analyzing a real-world crime dataset (2020â€“present) to identify trends, seasonal patterns, and other factors influencing crime rates. The analysis follows a structured approach as per the project guidelines.

Overview of Tasks
The project is structured as follows:
Task 1: Data Preprocessing
Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
Task 2: RFM Calculation
Compute Recency, Frequency, and Monetary values.
Task 3: RFM Segmentation
Group customers based on RFM scores.
Task 4: Customer Segmentation
Use clustering techniques (e.g., K-Means) for deeper segmentation.
Task 5: Segment Profiling
Define profiles for customer segments.
Task 6: Marketing Recommendation
Develop actionable strategies based on the analysis.
Task 7: Visualization
Present findings through effective charts and graphs.

Setup Instructions
Clone the repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/IE6400_Project2.git
cd IE6400_Project2


Install dependencies: Ensure Python 3.8+ is installed. Use pip to install required libraries:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt


Run the project: Execute the main analysis script:
bash
Copy code
python main_analysis.py



Data Preprocessing
Key preprocessing steps include:
Handling missing data via imputation or row removal.
Converting date columns for time-based analysis.
Removing duplicate rows and invalid data (e.g., negative values).
Ensuring correct data types for efficient processing.

Analysis Framework
RFM Analysis: Calculate recency, frequency, and monetary scores to understand customer behaviors.
Segmentation: Use K-Means clustering to group customers into actionable segments.
Profiling: Profile each segment to guide marketing strategies.

Visualizations
Insights are presented through:
Trends and seasonal patterns in crime rates.
Distribution of RFM scores and customer segmentation.
Cluster characteristics using box plots and heatmaps.

Recommendations
Key strategies include:
Engagement for High-Value Customers: Loyalty programs and exclusive offers.
Reactivation Campaigns: Incentives for inactive customers.
Upselling Opportunities: Encourage frequent customers to spend more.
